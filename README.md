# üß† Breast Cancer Prediction using Machine Learning

This project aims to classify breast cancer tumors as **Malignant (1)** or **Benign (0)** using various machine learning classification algorithms. It utilizes the **Breast Cancer Wisconsin Dataset**, and compares the performance of multiple models to find the most accurate classifier.

## üìå Objective

- Apply and compare multiple machine learning algorithms.
- Evaluate their performance using standard classification metrics.
- Identify the best performing model.

---

## üóÉÔ∏è Dataset

- **Instances**: 569
- **Features**: 30 numerical features (mean radius, mean texture, etc.)
- **Target**: `diagnosis`  
  - B = Benign ‚Üí 0  
  - M = Malignant ‚Üí 1

> Note: Dataset should be in CSV format. Example: `breast_cancer_data.csv`
